Grand Shining

My 411:
I am a lover of all things Cybersecurity and Cloud. I was a SOC analyst for 1.5 years, and making a transition into a Cloud Engineer.

I genuinely get excited when learning new things. Im currently buiding my skillset in Automation, scripting, building CI/CD pipelines, and most importantly problem solving. There are so many tools in the DevOps space, but my main focuses are Git, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Python and Linux.
